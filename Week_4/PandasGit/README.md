# Welcome to the Pandas Tutorials

This is an updated/modified version of [**Brandon’s Pandas Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw) from 2015. This is one of the best Pandas tutorials out there (even creators of this course went through this tutorial :)).

The first instance of this tutorial was delivered at PyCon 2015 in Montréal.

Clone this repo and complete the activities as instructed on Compass. 

The data for the tutorial can be downloaded from [**here**](https://learningimages.s3.amazonaws.com/Data%20BC/Statistical%20Modelling%20in%20Python/imdb_pandas.zip). Put these .csv files in a folder called `data` in your local repo - the files are a bit too big to fit on GitHub nicely ;)
